# Wholesale Customer Loyalty 

**Please limit yourself to 4 hours time!**

### The Goal

You work at a small food service supply wholesaler that principally services the hotel/restaurant and retail channels. Currently, your company is working on designing a customer loyalty program but your CEO is unsure of the best way to proceed - the current thinking is a loyalty program that incentivizes customers to purchase across multiple offering categories (e.g., if a customer purchases from the grocery, frozen, and deli categories, they receive a discount).

Your CEO would like you to examine annual spending by the companyâ€™s current customers to understand if such a program would be attractive to the largest subgroup of customers.
