**Please limit yourself to 4 hours of time!**

### The Goal

You work as a data scientist at a credit card company. A senior VP is leading an effort to reduce costs associated with signup incentives by offering credit cards with carefully targeted benefits that will attract new cardholders. As a first step, she would like you to examine cardholder data collected over the last 6 months in order to understand the various kinds of users who use the companyâ€™s products. She is especially interested in getting an idea of which benefits to associate with each new card offering. 

### The Data
The data consists of a csv file with 8950 rows (one for each cardholder) organized in columns with descriptive headers.
