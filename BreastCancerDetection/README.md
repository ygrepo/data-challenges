## Breast Cancer Cell Detection


#### Please limit yourself to 4 hours time!

You belong to the data team at a local research hospital. You've been tasked with developing a means to help doctors diagnose breast cancer. You've been given data about biopsied breast cells; where it is benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous).

1. What features of a cell are the largest drivers of malignancy?

2. How would a physician use your product?

3. There is a non-zero cost in time and money to collect each feature about a given cell. How would you go about determining the most cost-effective method of detecting malignancy?



### Please push your submissions to the Submissions sub-folder with the naming convention: lname_fname.
