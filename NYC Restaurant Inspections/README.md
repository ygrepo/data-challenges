# NYC Restaurant Inspections
## Please limit yourself to 4 hours time!
### Place your submissions to the Submissions sub-folder with the naming convention: lastname_firstname

## Goals

You have been provided with a dataset containing inspection ratings for NYC restaurants. The structure of the files are normalized and contain various attributes regarding the restaurants and their inspections.


By design, this is an open-ended analysis. Feel free to identify trends, draw insights and
recommendations (think: customer and/or inspector perspective). You are welcome to use any
number of tools that you have at your disposal to complete this analysis. Because this is
open-ended it is feasible that an analysis can take days if not weeks to consider all angles but for the sake of everyone's time we do not expect you spend more than 4 hours working on this. Remember that the purpose of this is to showcase your analytical skills.
Please provide documentation of code cleaning and analysis (any code, scratch work, etc) -
more info the better. This is great way for us to understand how you are thinking through the project. 

Be as creative as you'd like but please be prudent with your time.

## Some assumptions about the project
1. Potential customers would prefer to not get sick from the food they eat. But completely
avoiding lower-grade restaurants might be an oversimplification. There are some
tradeoffs to be considered here.

2. There are a limited number of inspectors and inspections take time. Therefore the
number of inspections is also limited.

3. Your stakeholders are looking to you for context and recommendations.
